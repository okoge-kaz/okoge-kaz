### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year Master's student working at the intersection of HPC and Machine Learning. 
My research focuses on distributed training of large models and low-precision training. 
Also, I am in charge of the maintenance of Pre-training Library for LLMs and conducting experiments on training LLMs. 

I am a core contributor of [Swallow Project](https://swallow-llm.github.io/index.en.html) which is a Japanese LLM development initiative.
